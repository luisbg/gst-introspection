Random segfault (trace):

Happens sometimes when trying to redirect X texture to the gtk drawable and if there is an element such as videobalance in the pipeline (after receiving the "prepare-xwindow-id" event)

Can be reproduced by either launching it periodically or by refreshing the pipeline quickly

Traces:

* Raw segfault
* "Fatal Python error: GC object already tracked"
* "The program 'gst-gengui' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 64 error_code 2 request_code 141 minor_code 19)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)"
